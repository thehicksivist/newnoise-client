                    Hey, I'm James! (That's my face up there^) I was born and
                    raised in Brisbane, Australia where I still live today, even
                    after a glorious year I spent in The Lake District in the
                    U.K (sorry friends, I like seeing the sky!). My parents were
                    kind enough to allow me in indulge in many hobbies and
                    interests from a young age; LEGO, basketball, skateboarding,
                    video games, miniature wargaming, guitar and later on films
                    and hiking. My focus leant most on guitar playing, after
                    starting playing in bands around the age of 14. It swept up
                    my life for over 10 years, until I started to get a little
                    perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started to, whether I wanted to or not initially, question
                    my abililites as a guitarist, musician, and a creative as a
                    whole. Hell I'd spent 10 years doing the things, but what
                    have I actually put out there? With technology as accessible
                    as it is to put creative work out there, what was holding me
                    back? Looking back now I think I've always apathetically
                    called myself a perfectionist, not really understanding what
                    that meant other than that I spent a lot of time creating,
                    but not a lot of time publishing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know I wanted to start doing something about it, so I
                    started my YouTube account under the Undoing Perfectionism
                    to do guitar covers as a way for me to learn and grow, which
                    was a good start. I got some feedback from people who felt
                    inclined to do something for themselves during this time,
                    which was awesome.
                </p>

                    But it all really kicked off when, after years of simply not
                    committing, I finally participated in{' '}

                    in 2020 (thanks Covid). What I saw in it was mostly a
                    curiousity as to what might happen, and to my surprise and
                    delight I felt empowered and determined to complete the
                    challenge. By the end though, it left me with a new sense of
                    energy, I'd increased my skills and I realised how much it
                    motivated others to share your work and accomplishments. You
                    can hear about what I learnt{' '}

                    I'm in such a mindset of 'just do things and share it' now
                    that, I don't even remember there being much of a period
                    where I was saying to myself "I'm going to start a podcast".
                    I just new it would be an awesome way to learn, and get it
                    out there so others in a similar position can learn too.

                    the best in your creative endeavours!
